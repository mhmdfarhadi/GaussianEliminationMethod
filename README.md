# GaussianEliminationMethod
a MATLAB function for solving linear equations using Gaussian Elimination
input is a N.(N+1) matrix -last column is b
first output is gaussian matrix(Upper triangular matrix) and second output is answers
NOTE: input matrix should not have zeros on it's principal diagonal ( i will fix this in next versions )
